# Parking Dataset Visualization

## Overview
This project presents an analysis of a parking dataset using various visualization techniques in **Tableau**. The visualizations provide insights into parking patterns, usage, violations, and trends over time, helping to better understand and manage parking systems.

## Visualizations
The project uses several visualization techniques, including:
- **Bar Charts**: To compare parking violations across different locations and time periods.
- **Line Charts**: To track parking trends over months/years.
- **Heatmaps**: To identify peak parking times and high-violation areas.
- **Pie Charts**: To represent the proportion of different types of parking violations.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- **Tableau Public**: You can view the visualization using [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/) or download the Tableau software to interact with the dataset locally.

### Viewing the Visualization
1. Download the `.twbx` (Tableau Packaged Workbook) file from this repository.
2. Open the file in Tableau to explore the visualizations interactively.
